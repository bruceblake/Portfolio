    "brief": "Full-stack engineer comfortable from low-level C++ game engines to cloud-native AI services. Currently pursuing B.S. in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech with a 3.85 GPA.",
    "detailed": "I'm a software engineer who thrives at the intersection of systems programming and modern web development. My journey spans from building custom 3D physics engines in C++ to creating AI-powered solutions that generate real revenue. I believe in understanding technology from the ground up - whether that's implementing collision detection algorithms or designing distributed systems at Google scale.",
    "uniqueValue": "I bring a rare combination of low-level systems understanding and high-level product thinking. While others use frameworks, I build engines. While others make demos, I create revenue-generating systems. This full-stack mastery from bare metal to cloud enables me to architect solutions that are both technically sound and business-impactful."
