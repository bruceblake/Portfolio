IMPORTANT: Add Your Resume Here
================================

Please add your resume PDF file to this directory with the name: resume.pdf

The file should be placed at:
/public/resume.pdf

This will enable the "Resume" download button in the header to work properly.

Note: The resume.pdf file is already in .gitignore, so it won't be accidentally committed to version control if you prefer to keep it private.
